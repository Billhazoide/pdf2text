~~Still doesn't convert to text but this is the idea~~

*Now it does convert!*

Convert pdf into text document (.txt), still just doing basic thing, a few updates incoming like:
⋅⋅* Delete pdf document after all the process.
⋅⋅* Adition of error handlers.
⋅⋅* Savin files outside the project.
⋅⋅* Self text corrector, depending on the quality of the pdf, we get lot of wrong words.
⋅⋅* Maybe an web application where stays up all night so we can convert files any time during the day or night.
⋅⋅* Few malfunction errors on option to not overwrite the images, checking.
