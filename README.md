# pdf2text

#### ~~Still doesn't convert to text but this is the idea~~

### **Now it does convert!**

#### Convert pdf into text document (.txt), still just doing basic thing...
Put your PDF files inside the "files/" folder, execute the script and everything will be
done by itself, with exception of exclusion of the images converted (files/temp/YOUR_FOLDER_PDF/), the text files (files/temp/extracted_text/YOUR_FOLDER_TXT/) and the original PDF files (files/).



#### A few updates incoming like:
- Delete pdf document after all the process.
- Adition of error handlers.
- Savin files outside the project.
- Self text corrector, depending on the quality of the pdf, we get lot of wrong words.
- Maybe an web application where stays up all night so we can convert files any time during the day or night.
- Few malfunction errors on option to not overwrite the images, checking.
- Self translater to any language.
